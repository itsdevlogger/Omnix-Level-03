- Check existing demos (To make sure they work with lates commit)
- Add create prefab and create menu toggle in menu maker
- Fade transition is not working properly, loadEnd value is being modified
- Dynaminc menu 
	While Loading:
	```C#
	if (allowTurnOff)
	{
		// Item that was selected when the menu was last active,
		// is present in this load, then select that 
		if (Selected.ItemData != null && GetItems().Contains(Selected.ItemData))	
		{
			Select(Selected.ItemData)
		}
		// First item in the list
		else if (firstItem != null)
		{
			Select(firstItem) 
		}
		else	
		{
			OnLoadingFailed();
		} 
	}
	else
	{
		Deselct();
	}
	```
	While Unloading: Deselct()
	This way, when the menu is 'loaded -> unloaded -> loaded', it does not create glitches
